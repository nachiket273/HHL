    "We see systems of linear equations in many real-life applications across a wide range of areas. Examples include the solution of Partial Differential Equations, the calibration of financial models, fluid simulation or numerical field calculation. The problem can be defined as, given a matrix $A\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N\\times N}$ and a vector $\\vec{b}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N}$, find $\\vec{x}\\in\\mathbb{C}^{N}$ satisfying $A\\vec{x}=\\vec{b}$\n",

    "A system of linear equations is called $s$-sparse if $A$ has at most $s$ non-zero entries per row or column. Solving an $s$-sparse system of size $N$ with a classical computer requires $\\mathcal{ O }(Ns\\kappa\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ running time using the conjugate gradient method <sup>[1](#conjgrad)</sup>. Here $\\kappa$ denotes the condition number of the system and $\\epsilon$ the accuracy of the approximation.\n",

    "The HHL algorithm estimates a function of the solution with running time complexity of $\\mathcal{ O }(\\log(N)s^{2}\\kappa^{2}/\\epsilon)$<sup>[2](#hhl)</sup>. The matrix $A$ must be Hermitian, and we assume we have efficient oracles for loading the data, Hamiltonian simulation, and computing a function of the solution.

The following uses `quantum_linear_solvers`, a Qiskit-based package. The most stratightforward way to install it  install it is through an old version of Qiskit using Python environments (see our README.md file). Alternatively, you can do a custom install downloading the code of this [repository](https://github.com/anedumla/quantum_linear_solvers) and installed as described in the corresponding `Readme` file. For the quantum simulator, `quantum_linear_solvers` already provides an implementation of the HHL algorithm requiring only the matrix $A$ and $|b\\rangle$ as inputs in the simplest example. Although we can give the algorithm a general Hermitian matrix and an arbitrary initial state as NumPy arrays, in these cases the quantum algorithm will not achieve an exponential speedup. This is because the default implementation is exact and therefore exponential in the number of qubits. There is no algorithm polynomial resources in the number of qubits that can prepare an exact arbitrary quantum state, or that can perform the exact operation $e^{iAt}$ for some general Hermitian matrix $A$. If we know an efficient implementation for a particular problem, the matrix and/or the vector can be given as `QuantumCircuit` objects.
